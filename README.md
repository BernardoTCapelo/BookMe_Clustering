# BookMe_Clustering
## Introduction
The BookMe company operates in the hospitality sector, providing accommodation to tourists and travellers, delivering necessary lodging services to those who travel the world, whether for leisure or business. It provides an international website where citizens can book their accommodation. Presently they have around 30,000 registered customers and serve more than 100,000 consumers a year. The website offers a variety of services, but they are focused in providing rooms with the best conditions possible. In order to control the quality of the services, every time a client makes a reservation, at the end of the stay, a survey is sent to complete on how the guest perceived the provided services. A scale of 0 to 5 is used to rate multiple aspects of the services, in this way, customers can reveal how satisfied they are regarding location, price, amenities provided, and others. 
Globally, the company had stable revenues and a healthy bottom line in the past three years, but the profit growth perspectives for the next three years are fickle. A few strategic initiatives are being considered to invert the situation. One of those is a Marketing efficiency program to improve marketing activities, focusing on boosting the marketing campaigns’ efficiency tremendously. The department has a clear objective in mind: try to cluster the different types of customers that the company has to create more efficient campaigns.
